## Warning! About WebDriver

* Selenium WebDriver doesn't newest version of browsers out of the box, e.g. Firefox 43+, see details [here (Ru only)](http://selenium2.ru/news/177-firefox47-issue-resolved.html#.V3TQNwkWg5R.facebook).
Thus, Selenide and Selenide for C# also will not support newest browsers as soon as works through Selenium.
